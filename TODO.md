TODO LIST:
- [ x ] Fix piece rendering offeset (pieces that are drawn to the screen appear to be off-center by a small amount)
    -> solved: the image itself was offset because of shadows
- [ ] Remove player-held piece when they click on a spot that doesn't contain piece
- [ ] Player can pick up piece of both colors
